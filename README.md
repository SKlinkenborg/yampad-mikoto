The Yampad project is an open-source, [QMK (Quantum Mechanical Keyboard Firmware)](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware) powered, hot-swappable, RGB-backlighted, OLED featured, mechanical numpad. 
The Yampad is a Macropad/Numpad which uses Cherry MX style mechanical switches laid out in the usual numeric pad layout. The only difference comes from the bottom row, which uses a 4 keys configuration, thus enabling the use of the macropad as a nav cluster.

I would like to thank [this video] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_urj-rF3bQ) for giving me the courage to go ahead and make it and @caksoylar for guiding me on pin mapping.
